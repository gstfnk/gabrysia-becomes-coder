# Gabrysia becomes a coder

Gabrysia wants to be the best coder in the universe ðŸš€  
This adventure cannot pass me!

## Build

We don't have very complicated nuclear solutions here, these are just simple window solutions and applications.  

We use a Visual Studio for coding.   So a simple way to build is to open **solution-name.sln** from any solution folder and run build for project.

## Contributing
Let's face it, the only people who want to contribute are [gstfnk](https://github.com/gstfnk) and [plumthedev](https://github.com/plumthedev).  

Thanks for all!
